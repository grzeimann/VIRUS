    Compute the median absolute deviation.

    Returns the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the array elements.
    The MAD is defined as ``median(abs(a - median(a)))``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : tuple, optional
        Axis along which the medians are computed. The default (axis=None)
        is to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.

    Returns
    -------
    median_absolute_deviation : ndarray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains
        integers, or floats of smaller precision than 64, then the output
        data-type is float64.  Otherwise, the output data-type is the same
        as that of the input.

    Examples
    --------

    This will generate random variates from a Gaussian distribution and return
    the median absolute deviation for that distribution::

        >>> from utils import median_absolute_deviation
        >>> from numpy.random import randn
        >>> randvar = randn(10000)
        >>> mad = median_absolute_deviation(randvar)

    Compute the biweight location for an array.

    Returns the biweight location for the array elements.
    The biweight is a robust statistic for determining the central
    location of a distribution.

    The biweight location is given by the following equation

    .. math::

        {\Sigma_{\|u_i\|<1} (1-u_i^2)^2}

    where M is the sample mean or if run iterative the initial guess,
    and u_i is given by

    .. math::

      u_{i} = \\frac{(x_i-M)}{cMAD}

    where MAD is the median absolute deviation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    c : float, optional
        Tuning constant for the biweight estimator.  Default value is 6.0.
    M : float, optional
        Initial guess for the biweight location.
    axis : tuple, optional

    Returns

    biweight_location : float

    Compute the biweight midvariance for an array.

    Returns the biweight midvariance for the array elements.
    The biweight midvariance is a robust statistic for determining
    the midvariance (i.e. the standard deviation) of a distribution.

    The biweight location is given by the following equation

    .. math::

      C_{bl}= (n')^{1/2} \\frac{[\Sigma_{|u_i|<1} (x_i-M)^2(1-u_i^2)^4]^{0.5}}
      {|\Sigma_{|u_i|<1} (1-u_i^2)(1-5u_i^2)|}

    where :math:`u_i` is given by

    .. math::

      u_{i} = \\frac{(x_i-M)}{cMAD}

    where MAD is the median absolute deviation.

    :math:`n'` is the number of data for which :math:`|u_i| < 1` holds, while the
    summations are over all i up to n:

    .. math::

        n' = \Sigma_{|u_i|<1}^n 1

    This is slightly different than given in the reference below, but
    results in a value closer to the true midvariance.

    The midvariance parameter c is typically 9.0.

    Parameters

    a : array-like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    c : float
        Tuning constant for the biweight estimator.  Default value is 9.0.
    M : float, optional
        Initial guess for the biweight location.
